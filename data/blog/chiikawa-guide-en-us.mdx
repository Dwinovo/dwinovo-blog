# Introduction

Welcome to the **Chiikawa Mod**! This is an unofficial mod based on the *Chiikawa* IP. This mod aims to bring those healing characters from the Chiikawa universe into your Minecraft world.

Not only can you encounter them during your adventures, but you can also tame them by feeding them food, making them your loyal companions. They feature independent inventories, multiple behavior modes, and can even take on professions like **Farmer**, **Swordsman**, or **Archer** based on the tools you provide, assisting you with automated farming or fighting alongside you against monsters.

During your adventure, you can find wild Chiikawas spawning in the following biomes. They mainly inhabit warm and temperate regions:

* **Plains**: Plains, Sunflower Plains
* **Savanna**: Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Desert
* **Other**: Swamp, Snowy Plains

## 💖 Taming & Interaction

### How to Tame
Hold a delicious food item in your main hand and **Right-Click** on a wild Chiikawa to feed it.
* **Success Rate**: Each feeding has a **30%** chance to successfully tame the Chiikawa.
* **Note**: Food will be consumed regardless of whether the taming is successful or not.

### Accepted Food List
Chiikawas are absolute "foodies" and accept most vanilla food items:

> 🍎 **Fruits & Vegetables**: Apple, Carrot, Golden Carrot, Melon Slice, Potato, Sweet Berries, Glow Berries, Beetroot
>
> 🍖 **Meats (Cooked)**: Steak, Cooked Chicken, Cooked Porkchop, Cooked Mutton, Cooked Rabbit, Cooked Cod, Cooked Salmon
>
> 🍞 **Baked Goods & Snacks**: Bread, Baked Potato, Cookie, Pumpkin Pie, Golden Apple
>
> 🥣 **Soups & Drinks**: Mushroom Stew, Rabbit Stew, Honey Bottle

### Companion Interaction
* **Healing**: After taming, Right-Clicking your pet with any of the foods listed above will heal it for **4 HP**.
* **Inventory System**: **Right-Click** your tamed pet to open its inventory.
    * **Capacity**: 16 slots of storage space.
    * **Equipment**: Includes one main-hand slot (used for equipping tools or weapons).

## 🧠 Behavior Modes

You can cycle through three behavior modes by **Crouching (Shift) + Right-Clicking** on your pet. The system will display the current mode status.

### 1. Follow Mode
The default mode. Your pet will follow you closely as you explore the world.
* **Catch-up Mechanism**: If the distance exceeds 7 blocks, it will sprint towards you.
* **Teleport**: If the distance exceeds 20 blocks, it will teleport directly to your side (to prevent getting lost).

### 2. Sit Mode
The pet stays put.
* The pet will sit in place, will not move, and will not trigger teleportation.
* **AI State**: Although it sits still, it will still look at nearby entities.

### 3. Work Mode
The core of automation!
* When switched to this mode, the pet will **memorize its current coordinates** as its "Workstation."
* It will begin executing the logic for its current profession (see below).
* **Wandering**: If there is no work to do, it will wander around the workstation but will never stray too far from the anchored coordinates.
