## 🌏 Spawning Mechanics

During your adventure, you can find wild Chiikawas spawning in the following biomes. They mainly inhabit warm and temperate regions:

- **Plains**: Plains, Sunflower Plains
- **Savanna**: Savanna, Savanna Plateau, Desert
- **Other**: Swamp, Snowy Plains

---

## 💖 Taming & Interaction

### How to Tame

Hold a delicious food item in your main hand and **Right-Click** on a wild Chiikawa to feed it.

- **Success Rate**: Each feeding has a **30%** chance to successfully tame the Chiikawa.
- **Note**: Food will be consumed regardless of whether the taming is successful or not.

### Accepted Food List

Chiikawas are absolute "foodies" and accept most vanilla food items:

> 🍎 **Fruits & Vegetables**: Apple, Carrot, Golden Carrot, Melon Slice, Potato, Sweet Berries, Glow Berries, Beetroot
>
> 🍖 **Meats (Cooked)**: Steak, Cooked Chicken, Cooked Porkchop, Cooked Mutton, Cooked Rabbit, Cooked Cod, Cooked Salmon
>
> 🍞 **Baked Goods & Snacks**: Bread, Baked Potato, Cookie, Pumpkin Pie, Golden Apple
>
> 🥣 **Soups & Drinks**: Mushroom Stew, Rabbit Stew, Honey Bottle

### Companion Interaction

- **Healing**: After taming, Right-Clicking your pet with any of the foods listed above will heal it for **4 HP**.
- **Inventory System**: **Right-Click** your tamed pet to open its inventory.
  - **Capacity**: 16 slots of storage space.
  - **Equipment**: Includes one main-hand slot (used for equipping tools or weapons).

---

## 🧠 Behavior Modes

You can cycle through three behavior modes by **Crouching (Shift) + Right-Clicking** on your pet. The system will display the current mode status.

### 1. Follow Mode

The default mode. Your pet will follow you closely as you explore the world.

- **Catch-up Mechanism**: If the distance exceeds 7 blocks, it will sprint towards you.
- **Teleport**: If the distance exceeds 20 blocks, it will teleport directly to your side (to prevent getting lost).

### 2. Sit Mode

The pet stays put.

- The pet will sit in place, will not move, and will not trigger teleportation.
- **AI State**: Although it sits still, it will still look at nearby entities.

### 3. Work Mode

The core of automation!

- When switched to this mode, the pet will **memorize its current coordinates** as its "Workstation."
- It will begin executing the logic for its current profession (see below).
- **Wandering**: If there is no work to do, it will wander around the workstation but will never stray too far from the anchored coordinates.
